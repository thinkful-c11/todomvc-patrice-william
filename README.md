This is a backend API using a ToDo MVC style JavaScript web app.
It allows you to get, create, delete and update to do items.
It also allows you to group todo items as completed or active.
We created a Postgres database then converted it to a cloud database so that we could have it run CI with Travis and hosted the web app with Heroku.
